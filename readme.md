234 Random Points within a Circle

Description

Greetings Rubyists,

Generating random numbers is a useful feature and Ruby provides us with Kernel.rand to generate numbers uniformly distributed between zero and one. If we want to generate random numbers with other distributions, then weâ€™ll need to do a little work. The quiz this week is to generate random points uniformly distributed within a circle of a given radius and position.

This quiz is relatively simple, great if you are new to Ruby or strapped for time. Remember, it is contributions from people like you that make Ruby Quiz succeed!

Have fun!

Some guidelines used:

Setting a timelimit of 1hr. 
Posting to github no matter how far I get
Try and solve with irb rather than Googling

Start time 2:39
Given End time 3:39
Actual End time 3:44

Results:
  - I got tripped up in how to test random numbers in rspec, I noticed that my code would evaluate rand a certain way, but then when I put it in a should.equal rand situation, that evaluated to a different numbers.
